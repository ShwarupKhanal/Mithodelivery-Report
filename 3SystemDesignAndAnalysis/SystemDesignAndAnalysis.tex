\chapter{SYSTEM DESIGN AND ANALYSIS}
\section{System Analysis}
"Mitho Delivery" project involves breaking the project into small parts and creating prototypes to get feedback from users quickly. Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a fast approach to building software applications. RAD saves time by reusing existing components and focuses on user involvement. It's a flexible method that adapts to changes and helps identify and fix problems early.\\
Rapid Application Development (RAD) consists of four main phases that guide the development process:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Requirements Planning:} In this phase, the project team identifies and understands the application's goals and user requirements.
\item \textbf{Prototyping:} The prototyping phase focuses on creating a working model or prototype of the application. 
\item \textbf{Iterative Development:} The iterative development phase involves building the application in multiple stages or iterations. Each iteration typically focuses on a specific set of features or functionalities. 
\item \textbf{Deployment and Feedback:} Once the application is developed, it is deployed for real-world use. This phase involves the final implementation and integration of the application into the production environment. Feedback from end-users and stakeholders is collected to identify any areas that need further refinement or improvement.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Feasibility Analysis}
\subsection*{Economically Feasibility}
Utilizing free and open-source cross-platform software development tools like HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, and PHP offers significant economic feasibility advantages. These tools eliminate
the need for expensive proprietary software licenses, provide access to extensive community
support, and enable platform independence, resulting in cost savings. Their flexibility and
customization options allow tailored solutions without vendor lock-in. Furthermore, the scalability
and collaborative nature of open-source tools facilitate future enhancements and tap into a vast
pool of talent. Hence, it makes our system economically feasible.

\subsection*{Operational Feasibility}
Operational feasibility for a food delivery system involves the assessment of its practical viability. This encompasses the verification of adequate resources such as delivery staff and vehicles and the compatibility of the system with prevailing technology and processes. Adherence to legal regulations and the positive reception of customers are also encompassed. Through the consideration of these factors, the potential for the successful implementation of the food delivery system can be ascertained.

\subsection*{Technical Feasibility}
The technical feasibility of the Mitho Delivery food delivery system involves assessing its potential for construction utilizing available technology. The imperative is to ensure the smooth operational performance and the safeguarding of user data. Through consideration of these factors, the determination of the successful construction and operation of the Mitho Delivery webpage can be reached.
