This user-friendly webpage allows customers to explore restaurant menus and place orders effortlessly. With a strong commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, Mitho Delivery guarantees timely delivery of delicious meals to customers' doorsteps. As the online food delivery trend continues to reshape dining habits, our project, "Mitho Delivery: Joy in Food," focuses on creating an intuitive and responsive website. This platform aims to connect users with a diverse array of restaurants and culinary delights, enhancing the joy of relishing favorite dishes from the comfort of their homes or workplaces.

\section{Problem Statement}
Online food delivering systems may encounter various challenges that can negatively impact the customer experience. One common issue is late delivery, which can occur due to logistical or operational issues. Technical issues with the website can also disrupt the ordering process, causing frustration for customers. Another problem is that the limited coverage area of the delivery service, which can restrict access for customers in certain regions. Some platforms may impose additional service charges, leading to dissatisfaction among customers.\\\\ Furthermore, if employee services are not well-managed, it can result in delays and poor service quality. Lastly, a lack of care for the products ordered by customers, such as mishandling or inadequate packaging, can lead to disappointment and dissatisfaction. Addressing these challenges is crucial for online food delivering systems to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty.
